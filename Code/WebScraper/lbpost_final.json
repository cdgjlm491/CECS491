Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend\u2019s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend\u2019s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. \u201cThe defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,\u201d prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12.

Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend\u2019s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. \u201cThe defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,\u201d prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend\u2019s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. \u201cThe defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,\u201d prosecutors said.

When officers arrived, they saw smoke coming from within, according to Long Beach police spokesman Rudy Garcia. Long Beach firefighters soon arrived and forced their way into the business to extinguish the fire. Once the fire was put out, officers entered the business and took the suspect into custody without incident, police said. The man was briefly hospitalized after sustaining minor injuries from the fire, Garcia said. Once cleared from the hospital, he was booked at Long Beach Jail on suspicion of arson, obstruction, burglary and being a felon in possession of ammo, police said. His bail was set at $75,000. Authorities identified the man as 61-year-old Wilmington resident Richard Calderon. The Long Beach Fire Department\u2019s arson unit is investigating the incident.
