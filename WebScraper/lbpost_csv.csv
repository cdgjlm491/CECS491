Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

The passenger in the vehicle, a woman, stayed in the vehicle and was taken into custody, he said. Police arrested the man without incident after they formed a perimeter around the home in the 1700 block of Gardenia Avenue and called him out. A separate suspected DUI crash on Cherry Avenue and Fourth Street is unrelated, he said. In that incident, two vehicles crashed at about 10:05 a.m. When police got there, they found a car flipped over with the driver still inside. The officers helped the driver out of the car and called paramedics for his injuries, but he refused medical attention at the scene, Herrera said. He was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12.

2 DUIs reported this morning in Alamitos Beach; one ends in pursuit,2020-04-24 12:04:29,Valerie Osier,"Long Beach police arrested two men suspected of driving under the influence in separate incidents around 10 a.m. this morning. In the first incident, police started pursuing a driver in the area of Hellman Street and Walnut Avenue at about 10 a.m. after they suspected the driver was intoxicated, Sgt. Alvino Herrera said. “During the pursuit, the male adult driver stopped the vehicle and ran into a residence officers believed he was familiar with,” Herrera said. The passenger in the vehicle, a woman, stayed in the vehicle and was taken into custody, he said. Police arrested the man without incident after they formed a perimeter around the home in the 1700 block of Gardenia Avenue and called him out. A separate suspected DUI crash on Cherry Avenue and Fourth Street is unrelated, he said. In that incident, two vehicles crashed at about 10:05 a.m. When police got there, they found a car flipped over with the driver still inside. The officers helped the driver out of the car and called paramedics for his injuries, but he refused medical attention at the scene, Herrera said.

Man charged in fatal stabbing of Good Samaritan,2020-04-21 16:58:36,Valerie Osier,"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend’s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend’s mother’s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend’s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. “The defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,” prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza’s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.
