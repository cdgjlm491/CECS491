At that location, officers learned a child was inside the home with the suspect, police said. SWAT was activated but the suspect surrendered before they arrived, according to the LBPD. The child was later found sleeping unharmed and not believed to be in any danger. Authorities arrested Isaac Perez-Benitez, 20, of Long Beach on suspicion of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. He was booked into Long Beach Jail where he was being held on $50,000 bail. In addition, two male Long Beach teens\u2014a 15-year-old and 16-year-old\u2014and a a male 16-year-old from Perris were taken to the Long Beach police juvenile booking facility where they were booked in connection with the robbery and released into the custody of their legal guardians with the promise to appear in court, Dean said.

In the first incident, police started pursuing a driver in the area of Hellman Street and Walnut Avenue at about 10 a.m. after they suspected the driver was intoxicated, Sgt. Alvino Herrera said. \u201cDuring the pursuit, the male adult driver stopped the vehicle and ran into a residence officers believed he was familiar with,\u201d Herrera said. The passenger in the vehicle, a woman, stayed in the vehicle and was taken into custody, he said. Police arrested the man without incident after they formed a perimeter around the home in the 1700 block of Gardenia Avenue and called him out. A separate suspected DUI crash on Cherry Avenue and Fourth Street is unrelated, he said. In that incident, two vehicles crashed at about 10:05 a.m. When police got there, they found a car flipped over with the driver still inside.

Officers spotted the suspect about 3 p.m., and were led on a chase on the southbound Harbor (110) Freeway and the eastbound Artesia (91) Freeway, according to ABC7. The chase came to a halt when the suspect crashed into another vehicle near Cherry Avenue, but a standoff ensued for about an hour, shutting down both sides of the freeway in the vicinity. The shirtless suspect exited and re-entered the car several times, as officers negotiated with him and a K-9 stood-by on the other side of the freeway. Officers moved in on the suspect about 4:25 p.m. and took him into custody without further incident.

Valerie Osier","7":"A Signal Hill man pleaded not guilty, Tuesday, to charges that he fatally stabbed a Good Samaritan trying to detain him for violating a restraining order on April 3. Police said Edson Rufino, 19, was in violation of a restraining order his girlfriend\u2019s mother had against him when he went to her home on 400 block of E. 21st Street. The victim, 31-year-old Leandro Maza, was visiting Long Beach with his father and fiance from Mar del Plata, Argentina, according to Argentinian newspaper Clarin. Police initially said Maza was the girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s roommate, but it appears he was an acquaintance. Prosecutors said when the mother called the police for violating the restraining order, Rufino threatened the girlfriend\u2019s brother and another visitor to the home with a knife. He then fled to another home near the 2000 block of Linden Avenue, where Maza was staying. Maza then tried to keep Rufino detained until police got there, prosecutors said. \u201cThe defendant reportedly pushed his way out of the home and fatally stabbed Maza,\u201d prosecutors said. Rufino has been charged with one felony count of murder, two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, as well as one misdemeanor count each of contempt of court and resisting arrest. If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison. His bail is set at $2 million and he is scheduled to return to court on May 12. Maza\u2019s family is desperately trying to fundraise to get his body home to Argentina, but the effects of the pandemic are further complicating that effort, according to Clarin.
